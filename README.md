This project has been developed by the attendees of the “Vivid Electronics Workshop” run by [Kazoosh](https://github.com/KAZOOSH) at [The WE Festival](https://we-festival.org/) 2015. A write-up of the workshop is available in German at [kazoosh.com](http://kazoosh.com/#/root%252Fworkshops). The DMX library used to drive the LED spot can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/bitfasching/leodmx).
